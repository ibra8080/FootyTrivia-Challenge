## Credits

### Content
I would like to express my gratitude to the following YouTubers for their invaluable tutorials, which greatly helped me in understanding JavaScript and the programming logic required for this project:

#### Osama Al-Zero: 
His detailed explanations of JavaScript and JSON, as well as his QuizApp work project, provided me with a strong foundation and clear insights into the concepts and practical applications of JavaScript.

#### Ali Aslan: 
His comprehensive tutorial on building a Quiz App was instrumental in guiding me through the process of creating this project. His step-by-step instructions and explanations made complex topics more accessible and easier to understand.

Following their tutorials has significantly enhanced my knowledge and skills in JavaScript, allowing me to develop FootyTrivia with confidence and competence. I highly recommend their content to anyone looking to deepen their understanding of web development and JavaScript.
