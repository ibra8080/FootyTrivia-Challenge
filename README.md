### Typography

- [Raleway](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Raleway) was used for all text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used in the ending messages.

## Wireframes


To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.
